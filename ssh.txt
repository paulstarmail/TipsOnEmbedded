Connecting through SSH to Server
================================
If there is no Public key in ~/.ssh directory of the client, then create it using:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<A comment, preferably email ID to identify in the server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys>"

Then:
ssh-copy-id <user name>@<IP address of server>
Or:
ssh-copy-id -p <port> <user name>@<IP address of server>

If you saved your key with a non-default name, specify it with the -i flag:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/<My custom key> <user name>@<IP address of server>
Or:
ssh -p <port> -i ~/.ssh/<My custom key> <user name>@<IP address of server>
